    "Instead, you will need to download a copy of this code, and store it on your computer. Click the above link, https://github.com/morimotolab/systems_class, and then click on the large green button that says \"Clone or download\" and download the code as a ZIP file to your desktop. In case that after the download you only see a ZIP file on the desktop, rather than a folder containing the individual files of the code of the tutorial, you will need to uncompress the ZIP file. On many computers this will be possible by double-clicking on the ZIP file. This can also be accomplished on the (unix) command line by running: `unzip [filepath]`.\n",

While you could also get those tools separately, it is much more convenient to know that the most needed tools will already be present and that they will work together. Anaconda already contains every tool necessary for this tutorial (and many more for scientific computing)\n",

With this in mind, go to the following page and download and subsequently install a Python 3 version: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual  (scroll down)"
