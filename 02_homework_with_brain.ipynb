    "Why this tutorial will be useful:\n",
    "- This tutorial assumes no programing background.\n",
    "- You will learn most computational operations you will use during the course\n",
    "- <font color='green'>You will solely need to change the code at positions marked with ```# <- adapt code here```</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Main purpose of tutorial:\n",
    "- Execute to ensure that your computer is readily set up for the class.\n",
    "- Provide a reference of commands that you will require during the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional purposes of tutorial:\n",
    "- Recapitulate concepts around gene expression by relating them to numbers\n",
    "- Realize that different assumptions (which can all be good and not intrinsically wrong) can shape the results of a computational analysis\n",
    "- Provide templates that you can  copy and modify for your own research (outside and independent of this class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stages:\n",
    "- Stage 0: Getting the data\n",
    "- Stage 1 How many genes are transcribed in the brain of young adults with an average of at least one transcript molecule per cell?: **loading tables**, **filtering tables**, **functions**, **visualizing distributions**\n",
    "- Stage 2 How many <font color=\"green\">protein-coding genes</font> are transcribed in the brain of young adults with an average of at least one transcript molecule per cell? **extracting patterns from text**, **clean tables**, **combining tables**, **aggregate statistics**\n",
    "- Stage 3 Are genes of the chaperome weakly or strongly transcribed genes, and are some categories of chaperones more transcribed than others?: **importing excel**, **boxplots**, \n",
